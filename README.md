# MachineLearning-with-Cryptanalysis

This project utilises Machine Learning Optimisation Algorithms to find out whether it can decrypt a Polyalphabetic cipher, as well as how they perform in this scenario. This includes using a fitness scoring of ngrams, which uses a suitable file from Practical Cryptography to score the ngrams of each four letters.
